# distbeta
Extract distances for each sample between different timepoint starting from a dissimilarity matrix.

Imagine a dissimilarity matrix containing beta diversities for a follow-up study. Several time points exist and we want to study beta diversity differences for each individual, between couple of timepoints. 

If treatment is responsible for a change in host microbiome, we'll maybe observe bigger changes on treated individuals beta-diversity between subsequent time points.
